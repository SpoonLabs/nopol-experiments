    <section name="Aim">
      <p>This page aims to be a handy reference not only of the work done but also of work pending for the next planned release. 
      Users who want new features should submit patches to this page in the unclassified section of this document. 
      Developers who want to lend a hand can grab tasks from this page. Everyone can see the progress which is being made.</p>

    <section name="TODO list">
      <p>The following is a list of items still <code>TODO</code> for Math.  Contributions are welcome!</p>
      <subsection name="Documentation and Code Conformance Tasks">
        <p>Many of these will always be a required. Please focus on applying format standards and provide as many 
        test cases as possible for your code.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Develop user's guide following the package structure.</dt>
          <dd>Incomplete Sections:  3.1 Linear Algebra Overview, 3.2 Real Matrices, 3.3 Solving Linear Systems, 6.1 Utilities Overview, 6.2 Double Array Utilities, 6.4 Binomial Coefficients, ..., 6.5 Statistical Computation Utilities, 7.4 Complex Formatting</dd>
          <dt>Performance and accuracy testing.</dt>
          <dd>If anyone is interested in helping out here, what we could really use is a wider selection of test cases for the core
           numerical functions and validation against either other packages (e.g. R for the statistical stuff), verified datasets,
           or experiments comparing implementions using floats to doubles.</dd>
          <dt>Test Coverage.</dt>
          <dd>Clover tests show gaps in test path coverage. Get all tests to 100% coverage.  Also improve test data and 
           boundary conditions coverage.</dd>
          <dt>Code review.</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Code review is a continuous process that all Contributors and Developers should practice while working on the code base.</p>

              <li>CheckStyle with modified properties still shows many errors.  Try to clean these up.</li>

              of a complex number library has been donated by Brent Worden. It has been added
