   <p>
    The Java programming language and the math extensions in
    Commons Lang provide implementations for only the most basic
    mathematical algorithms. Routine development tasks such as
    computing basic statistics or solving a system of linear equations
    require components not available in Java or Commons Lang.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most basic mathematical or statistical algorithms are available in
    open source implementations, but to assemble a simple set of
    capabilities one has to use multiple libraries, many of which have
    more restrictive licensing terms than the ASF. In addition, many
    of the best open source implementations (e.g. the R statistical
    package) are either not available in Java or require large support
    libraries and/or external dependencies to work.
   </p>
   <p>
    Commons Math is a library of lightweight, self-contained
    mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common
    problems not available in the Java programming language or Commons
    Lang.
   </p>
   <p>
    Guiding principles:
    <ol>
     <li>
      Real-world application use cases will determine development
      priority.
     </li>
     <li>
      This package will emphasize small, easily integrated components
      rather than large libraries with complex dependencies and
      configurations.
     </li>
     <li>
      All algorithms will be fully documented and follow generally
      accepted best practices.
     </li>
     <li>
      In situations where multiple standard algorithms exist, a
      Strategy pattern will be used to support multiple
      implementations.
     </li>
     <li>
      Limited dependencies. No external dependencies beyond Commons
      components and the core Java 2 platform.
     </li>
    </ol>

     Yes - I know that it should be commons-maths. But think of all the
     bandwidth saved by losing that 's' ;)

   <subsection name="Nightly Builds">
    <p>
     Nightly builds are built once a day from the current CVS HEAD.
     This is (nearly) the lastest code and so should be treated with
     caution!
    </p>
    <p>
     You can get the nightly builds from <a
     href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-commons/nightly/commons-math/">here</a>
